# Execute a transaction

If you want to execute a transaction follow this:

Make sure you have the following installed:

1. You'll need to open up a second terminal and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc
cd hardhat-fund-me-fcc
yarn
yarn hardhat node
```

This will deploy a sample contract and start a local hardhat blockchain.

2. Update your `constants.js` with the new contract address.

In your `constants.js` file, update the variable `contractAddress` with the address of the deployed "FundMe" contract. You'll see it near the top of the hardhat output.

3. Connect your [metamask](https://metamask.io/) to your local hardhat blockchain.

> **PLEASE USE A METAMASK ACCOUNT THAT ISNT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REAL MONEY.**
> I usually use a few different browser profiles to separate my metamasks easily.

In the output of the above command, take one of the private key accounts and [import it into your metamask.](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-Account)

Additionally, add your localhost with chainid 31337 to your metamask.

5. Reserve the front end with `yarn http-server`, input an amount in the text box, and hit `fund` button after connecting
